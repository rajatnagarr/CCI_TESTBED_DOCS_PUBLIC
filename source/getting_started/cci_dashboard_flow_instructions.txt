Instructions for Adding the CCI Dashboard Flow Diagram to Documentation
==================================================================

The CCI Dashboard User Flow has been added to the user_access.rst file in the getting_started directory. To enhance the documentation with a visual representation of the user flow, you can generate an image from the Mermaid diagram in the HTML file.

Option 1: Generate an Image Using the Mermaid Live Editor
--------------------------------------------------------

1. Copy the Mermaid diagram code from the HTML file (CCI_Dashboard_User_Flow.html):

```
flowchart TD
    A[User Lands on CCI Dashboard Login Page] --> B[User Inputs Credentials]
    B --> C{Authentication}
    C -->|Successful| D[Main Navigation Page]
    C -->|Failed| E[Error Message]
    E --> B
    
    D --> F[Non-RT Dashboard]
    D --> G[Near-RT Dashboard]
    D --> H[Clear-ML]
    D --> I[OpenStack Login]
    
    F --> J[Non-RT RIC Management]
    F --> K[rApps Management]
    F --> L[Policy Management]
    
    G --> M[Near-RT RIC Management]
    G --> N[xApps Management]
    G --> O[E2 Node Management]
    
    I --> P[OpenStack Authentication]
    P --> Q[OpenStack Dashboard]
```

2. Go to the Mermaid Live Editor: https://mermaid.live/
3. Paste the diagram code into the editor
4. Click on "Download SVG" or "Download PNG" to save the image
5. Add the image to the source/_static directory
6. Update the user_access.rst file to include the image:

```
.. image:: ../_static/cci_dashboard_flow.png
   :alt: CCI Dashboard User Flow
   :align: center
   :scale: 70%
```

Option 2: Use the HTML File to Generate an Image
----------------------------------------------

1. Open the CCI_Dashboard_User_Flow.html file in a web browser
2. The Mermaid diagram will be rendered on the page
3. Take a screenshot of the diagram
4. Crop the screenshot to include only the diagram
5. Save the image as cci_dashboard_flow.png
6. Add the image to the source/_static directory
7. Update the user_access.rst file to include the image as shown in Option 1

Option 3: Use a Mermaid CLI Tool
------------------------------

If you're comfortable with command-line tools, you can use the Mermaid CLI to generate an image:

1. Install Node.js if not already installed
2. Install the Mermaid CLI: `npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli`
3. Create a file named cci_dashboard_flow.mmd with the Mermaid diagram code
4. Run: `mmdc -i cci_dashboard_flow.mmd -o cci_dashboard_flow.png`
5. Add the image to the source/_static directory
6. Update the user_access.rst file to include the image as shown in Option 1

The CCI Dashboard User Flow information has been successfully added to the documentation. Adding an image will enhance the user experience by providing a visual representation of the flow.
