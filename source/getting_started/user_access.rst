Getting Started with the CCI xG Testbed
========================================

This section provides guidance on how to start using the CCI xG Testbed. It explains how to request access, how accounts are created, how resources are allocated, and how you can transition from the Testbed Portal to your experiment environment.

Access and Account Creation
---------------------------

How does a user get access?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To gain access to the testbed, you must first request the necessary resources. In your request, please include:

* A description of your research.
* The duration for which you require the resources.
* Any specific resource needs (compute, storage, network, etc.).
* Mostly by creating a Google Forms Sheet

Once your request is reviewed, the Administrative team will send you an email containing your access credentials:

* **OpenStack Credentials**: For accessing the OpenStack dashboard and user environment.
* **Gateway Credentials**: For secure access to the network gateway.
* **Redmine Credentials**: For project management and support.

How does the user create an account?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

User accounts are not self-service. To create an account, please send an email (fill the form and it will take 2 business days for approval) to the Testbed Admin Team with your research details and the reasons for needing the testbed resources. Your account will be created upon approval of your request.

Requesting Resources
-------------------

How does the user request resources?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Resource requests are submitted by emailing the Testbed Admin Team directly at: cci.xg.testbed.admin@cyberinitiative.org or Google Forms

Ensure that your email includes:

* Your research topic and objectives.
* The duration for which the resources are needed.
* Any additional requirements or specifications for the experiment.

Transitioning to the Experiment Environment
------------------------------------------

How does a user go from the CCI xG Testbed Portal/webpage to the user environment to run an experiment?

1. Log in to the CCI xG Testbed Portal.
