Getting Started with the CCI xG Testbed
========================================

This section provides guidance on how to start using the CCI xG Testbed. It explains how to request access,
how accounts are created, how resources are allocated, and how you can transition from the Testbed Portal
to your experiment environment.

Access and Account Creation
---------------------------

How does a user get access?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To gain access to the testbed, you must first request the necessary resources. In your request, please include:
 - A description of your research.
 - The duration for which you require the resources.
 - Any specific resource needs (compute, storage, network, etc.).

Once your request is reviewed, the Administrative team will send you an email containing your access credentials:
 - **OpenStack Credentials:** For accessing the OpenStack dashboard and user environment.
 - **Gateway Credentials:** For secure access to the network gateway.
 - **Redmine Credentials:** For project management and support.

How does the user create an account?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
User accounts are not self-service. To create an account, please send an email to the Testbed Admin Team
with your research details and the reasons for needing the testbed resources. Your account will be created
upon approval of your request.

Requesting Resources
--------------------

How does the user request resources?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Resource requests are submitted by emailing the Testbed Admin Team directly at: `cci.xg.testbed.admin@cyberinitiative.org <mailto:cci.xg.testbed.admin@cyberinitiative.org>`_


Ensure that your email includes:
 - Your research topic and objectives.
 - The duration for which the resources are needed.
 - Any additional requirements or specifications for the experiment.

Transitioning to the Experiment Environment
--------------------------------------------

How does a user go from the CCI xG Testbed Portal/webpage to the user environment to run an experiment?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once your account is active, you can access the experiment environment through the OpenStack dashboard.
Detailed instructions are provided in the CCI xG Testbed documentation as well as within the OpenStack
dashboard itself. Follow these steps:

 1. Log in to the CCI xG Testbed Portal.
 2. Use your provided OpenStack credentials to access the OpenStack dashboard.
 3. Navigate through the dashboard to launch your experiment environment.

For further step-by-step guidance, please refer to the dedicated sections in our documentation.
